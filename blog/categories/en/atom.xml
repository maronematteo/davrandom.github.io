    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am &mdash;desperately&mdash; writing a report. I have time until midnight.
Obviously I have to work from home, with a different pc. And obviously I&rsquo;m running into some missing pieces ;)</p>

<p>First problem, Texmaker complains about missing dictionary.
Googling around I found two interesting pages:
&ldquo;Texmaker Error : Canâ€™t open the dictionary&rdquo;:<a href="http://copiancestral.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/texmaker-error-cant-open-the-dictionary/">http://copiancestral.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/texmaker-error-cant-open-the-dictionary/</a> by <em>copiancestral</em>
&ldquo;Configuring the spell checker&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/doc.html#SECTION03">http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/doc.html#SECTION03</a></p>

<p>Carefully brewing the two I found my solution.</p>

<p>h3. First: locate your dictionary .aff</p>

<p>(You need findutils installed)
So type in your terminal</p>

<p>bc. locate *.aff</p>

<p>You should get a list of dictionaries like this (depending on your installation):</p>

<p>bc. elijah@seldon:~$ locate *.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/en_AU.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/en_GB.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/en_US.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/en_ZA.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/es.aff
/usr/share/hunspell/it_IT.aff
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en-GB.aff
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_GB.aff
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/en_ZA.aff
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/it-IT.aff
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/it_IT.aff</p>

<p>If not you have to install the desired myspell dictionary with your preferred package manager.</p>

<p>h3. Then: tell Texmaker where to find the correct .aff file</p>

<p>Open <em>Configure Texmaker</em> > <em>Editor</em> > <em>Spelling dictionary</em> and put the path to the desired <em>.aff file</em>.
It should work now.</p>

<p>Not always the ubuntu official repository has the newest software. Fortunately there are some people compiling the latest source code and sharing the packages. There are several technical options to achieve this. One &ldquo;official&rdquo; solution for Ubuntu is &ldquo;lauchpad,&rdquo;:launchpad.net where you can find many repositories with a lot of software.</p>

<p>In particular you may be interested in Maxima and Octave.</p>

<p>for <em>wxMaxima</em>:
* you may want to read this first: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Maxima">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Maxima</a>
* this is the repositoy in lauchpad <a href="https://launchpad.net/~blahota/+archive/wxmaxima/+packages">https://launchpad.net/~blahota/+archive/wxmaxima/+packages</a>
* and this is essentially the lines that you can cut and paste on your terminal to have the latest wxmaxima:</p>

<p>bc. sudo apt-add-repository ppa:blahota/wxmaxima
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wxmaxima</p>

<p>for <em>octave</em>:
* this is the repositoy in lauchpad <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mvanderkolff/+archive/octave-3.6">https://launchpad.net/~mvanderkolff/+archive/octave-3.6</a>
* and this is essentially the lines that you can cut and paste on your terminal to have the latest wxmaxima:</p>

<p>bc. sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mvanderkolff/octave-3.6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install octave</p>

<p>for <em>latest texlive</em></p>

<p>bc. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:texlive-backports/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive</p>

<p>Hope this helps

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Latest Cern Root 5.34.03 package for Ubuntu/Debian 64bits is available for download in my &ldquo;sourceforge project&rdquo;:<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/</a> with a nice and very helpful page :) just &ldquo;one click from here.&rdquo;:<a href="http://">http://</a>{{ root_url }}/images/projects/27/root-packages-for-debian-and-ubuntu</p>

<p>Check it out! &ldquo;(direct download)&rdquo;:<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/latest/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/latest/download</a></p>

<p>ps: I compiled this package on Ubuntu 10.04, since Ubuntu 12.04 doesn&rsquo;t allow anymore to put packages in /opt. Soon we will have to decide if:
&ndash; continue packaging in 10.04 with packages destistation /opt
&ndash; switch to 12.04 with destination /usr/local
Since I have both WM it&rsquo;s just a matter of taste. Any hint is very welcome.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last post was a bit long, so I searched for a way of showing a teaser in textpattern.
While in Drupal generating a teaser is more or less easy (it&rsquo;s more difficult to remove it with its &ldquo;read more&rdquo; link&hellip; I will talk about this somewhere in the future), in textpattern the information is a bit fragmented and spread in forums, plugins collections &hellip; but the easiest solution is always under your nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are the guide.&rdquo;:<a href="http://textpattern.com/faq/24/how-do-i-show-only-an-excerpt-in-article-lists">http://textpattern.com/faq/24/how-do-i-show-only-an-excerpt-in-article-lists</a>
It&rsquo;s not as straightforward as you might desire, but it works!

    <link href="http://davrandom.github.io/blog/2012/05/16/speech-recognition-under-linux/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://davrandom.github.io/blog/2012/05/16/speech-recognition-under-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(preamble: I do many things over the web every day, search for solutions, find solutions, implement solutions&hellip; then I forget everything. So some posts like this are just a collection of things for future memory)</p>

<p>I was searching for something like Dragon Naturally Speaking under Linux&hellip; well this doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist yet (apart from running DNS under wine). If you have different information please comment.</p>

<p>I found this &ldquo;nice article on Archlinux wiki&rdquo;:<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Speech_Recognition#Speech_Recognition">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Speech_Recognition#Speech_Recognition</a> with a nice list divided by types of speech recognition (copying from there):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Text-To-Speech</em> As it sounds, Text-To-Speech (or TTS) will manipulate a string of text into an audio clip. There are several programs available that perform TTS, some of which are command-line based (ideal for scripting) and others which provide a handy GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Simple Voice Control/Commands</em> This is the most basic form of Speech-To-Text application. These are designed to recognize a small number of specific, typically one-word commands and then perform an action. This is often used as an alternative to an application launcher, allowing the user for instance to say the word &ldquo;firefox&rdquo; and have his OS open a new browser window.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Full dictation/recognition</em> Full dictation/recognition software allows the user to read full sentences or paragraphs and translates that data into text on the fly. This could be used, for instance, to dictate an entire letter into the window of an email client. In some cases, these types of applications need to be trained to your voice and can improve in accuracy the more they are used.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I am mostly interested in the last one &hellip; from what I can understand none of them is yet completely working (in the sense of DNS does).
I downloaded &ldquo;Simon&rdquo;:<a href="http://simon-listens.org/">http://simon-listens.org/</a> but not tried yet. From what I can see &ldquo;here&rdquo;:<a href="http://simon-listens.blogspot.it/2012/05/simon-usability.html">http://simon-listens.blogspot.it/2012/05/simon-usability.html</a> they&rsquo;re at 0.3.80 release while &ldquo;here&rdquo;:<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/speech2text/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/speech2text/</a> you can download the 0.3.0 version&hellip; guess some svn/git compiling is required to obtain the most recent version.</p>

<p>Quoting from &ldquo;here:&rdquo;:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition_in_Linux">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition_in_Linux</a>
&ldquo;Recently, there has been a push to get a high-quality native GNU/Linux speech recognition engine developed. As a result, numerous projects dedicated to creating GNU/Linux speech recognition solutions were established. One major hurdle is the compilation of a speech corpus to enable production of acoustic models. In response, VoxForge, which aims to collect transcribed speech for the use with free and open-source speech recognition engines under the GPL license, was set up.&rdquo;
<em>(This wiki article is far from perfect&hellip; but these few lines are ok)</em></p>

<p>I gave a look also to &ldquo;VoxForge&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.voxforge.org/">http://www.voxforge.org/</a> and it&rsquo;s a project to <em>collect</em> transcribed speech, to build up open source &ldquo;speech libraries&rdquo; (&ldquo;speech corpus&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.voxforge.org/home/docs/faq/faq/what-is-a-speech-corpus-or-speech-corpora">http://www.voxforge.org/home/docs/faq/faq/what-is-a-speech-corpus-or-speech-corpora</a>). So this is only a piece of what I&rsquo;m searching for, but it&rsquo;s important to mention that <em>everyone can help this project simply reading some text</em>&hellip; &ldquo;checkout here.&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.voxforge.org/home/read">http://www.voxforge.org/home/read</a></p>

<p><em>Has anyone there an experience with OSS software doing full dictation/recognition?</em></p>
