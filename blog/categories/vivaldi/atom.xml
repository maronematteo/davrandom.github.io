    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>bq. <em>Q: Will it blend?</em>
A: Yes, though this does void the warranty.</p>

<p>h2. Aaron Seigo &ldquo;answers some questions&rdquo;:<a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/02/spark-answers.html">http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/02/spark-answers.html</a> about &ldquo;Spark&rdquo;:<a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/01/reveal.html">http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/01/reveal.html</a> .</p>

<p>??<em>Q: When can I buy one?</em>??
??A: Pre-order registration will open early next week. This was one piece in the puzzle that was taking a bit longer than I had hoped for to come together, but it&rsquo;s finally slotted in and our distribution partner has got the necessary infrastructure settled. I&rsquo;ll lift the veil off of the pre-order and our distribution strategy when it goes live.??</p>

<p>??<em>Q: When will Spark start shipping?</em>??
??A: We expect to start shipping Sparks to you starting in May 2012. We have a lot of pieces to coordinate, and not just technical issues like the OS image and the content add-on store, but things like packaging design, manufacturing, shipping, import, retail channel coordination. So far we&rsquo;re on track, but I don&rsquo;t want to offer a more precise date than &ldquo;May&rdquo; until we pull the trigger on production.??</p>

<p>I consider it as an interesting device, especially because I would like to install something like Navit&hellip; but:</p>

<p>??<em>Q: Can I get one with built-in 3G and GPS?</em>??
??A: Not in the first run of devices. We do plan on providing Spark models with 3G (BYOS: Bring your own SIM. ;) and GPS later.??</p>

<p>&hellip;so I&rsquo;ll wait :D</p>
