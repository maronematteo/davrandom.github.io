I'm *interested* in _open source, i.e. GNU/Linux, open hardware (openmoko, arduino, ...), open mapping (openstreetmap),  ... in music, acoustics, photography, motorbikes, traveling around, DIY, ..._

I have a "M.Sc.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree in "particle physics":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics from "University of Trieste (Italy).":http://df.units.it/?q=en

Now I'm enrolled at "UPF":http://www.upf.edu/en/ for a "Ph.D.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy in "Information and Communication Technologies.":http://www.upf.edu/dtic/en/ Meanwhile I work in a non-profit foundation called "Barcelona Media.":http://www.barcelonamedia.org/

Public Code:
* ATM my public code is very limited (for several reasons). In "this repository":https://bitbucket.org/davrandom/misc_projects/src I collect some files that I find useful (configuration files or nano-projects).
This might not be useful for other people, but after few times I forgot/lost code around, I simply decided that it's better to publish it. 


Presentations:
* TBD
