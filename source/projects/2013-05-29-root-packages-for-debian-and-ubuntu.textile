h2. What is ROOT?

"ROOT":http://root.cern.ch is a framwork for data analysis, written in C++ and developed by "CERN.":http://public.web.cern.ch/public/

h2. What are _you_ doing then?

As you might have noticed the debian packages (debs) for ROOT in Debian and Ubuntu repositories are quite old (5.18). So what I am doing is to build a monolithic package of ROOT.

h2. What are you _NOT_ doing?

I'm not a ROOT developer, and I do not answer to ROOT related questions.

h2. Some other details to know BEFORE download and installation

The enabled ROOT plugins are: minuit2 roofit unuran tmva (if you think you need some other, just write a comment here, I'll provide).

**Older than 5.34.07** packages are going to be installed on /opt/root, to not conflict with Root package provided by Ubuntu repos. 


h2. Download

I provide two version of ROOT package, one compiled for "64 bits":http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/latest-recommended/ and one for "32 bits":http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/32bits!/ processors. "Here":http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files you can find the two versions. "The most up-to-date is the 64 bits release. Download!":https://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/latest/download

h2. Installation

You double click on the downloaded package and Debian or Ubuntu will prompt a window... just follow the usual instructions. 

h2. Have fun!

If you like this packet and want to pay for my time, you are welcome ;) 
(important note: I'm not connected to cern developers in any way. I'm not asking for money, this package is free!)

If you have any doubt just ask (commenting down here or at sourceforge "here":https://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/forums/forum/1106773)... if you need help with ROOT, read the manual :)
